# Introduction
This report is written to summarize Sudoku project for class CSCI 631. There are five sections to this report, which are General Algorithm, Challenges and Solutions, Improved OCR Confidence, Possible Feature Improvement, and Conclusion. In General Algorithm, you will find the overall flow and design of the program. In Challenges and Solutions, you will find the roadblocks I’ve encountered in the project and how I solved them. In Improved OCR Confidence, I will explain in detail how I got the program to work perfectly for all input images. In Future Improvement, I noted two areas that can be improved when the need arises.  Lastly, I summarized, what I’ve learned from the project and the course in general. 

# General Algorithm 
The general algorithm of this project can be briefly described in the following steps: 
1.	Read in file 
2.	Convert to black and white image using a median filter
